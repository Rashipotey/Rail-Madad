# SIH 1711
AI based agentic workflow for automating complaint management system in Railways. 

### Library installations: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Project Objectives: 
 1. Automated Categorization and Prioritization: Integrate the system with the existing Rail Madad platform to streamline the complaint management process. 
 2. Image and Video Analysis: Use Al-powered image and video recognition to automatically categorize the nature of the complaint (e.g., coach cleanliness, damage, staff behaviour). 
 3. Urgency Detection: Implement Al to assess the severity of the issue from visual content and prioritize complaints that need immediate attention. 
 4. Enhanced Data Extraction: Text Recognition (OCR): Utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract textual information from images or videos, such as signage or documents, to gather more contexts about the complaint. 
 5. Metadata Analysis: Extract metadata from images and videos (e.g., timestamp, location) to provide additional information for more accurate and quicker resolution. 
 6. Automated Response and Routing: AI Chatbots: Deploy Al chatbots to provide instant acknowledgment and preliminary responses, collecting additional necessary information from the complainant. 
 7. Smart Routing: Use Al algorithms to route complaints to the most appropriate department or official based on the content of the photos or videos. 
 8. Predictive Maintenance: Issue Prediction: Implement machine learning models to predict recurring issues from the analysis of visual data trends, helping in proactive maintenance and reducing future complaints.
 9. Feedback and Continuous Improvement: Sentiment Analysis: Use Al to analyze the sentiment of feedback provided by complainants, identifying areas needing improvement. 
 10. Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the complaint resolution process through Al-driven analytics, making data-driven adjustments for process enhancement.
 11. Accuracy detection: Accuracy of Al-powered complaint detection can be analysed. ? Speed Analysis: Speed of complaint registration and resolution. ? 
 12. Resource Allocation: Use Al to analyze complaint patterns and allocates resources dynamically, ensuring that high-priority issues receive prompt attention.
